Official Pebble app for [/r/AppHookup](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppHookup). Get app deals for all platforms right on your wrist!

With this app, you can quickly and easily check daily app discounts and limited time free deals without browsing to reddit from your phone or computer. Obviously the app cannot let you act on the deals. But it's very convenient to quickly check the last 35 posts on the sub from the app to see if there is something worth getting.

If you don't know about the subreddit, [/r/AppHookup](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppHookup) is a reddit.com community where people share discounted apps and games for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac etc. including platforms like Steam and Origin with each other.

Download
--------

Search the Pebble App Store for "AppHookup".

For the curious
---------------

The app is written in Pebble.js (in beta at the time of writing). I have posted this code hoping that it helps out somebody who is trying to get into Pebble.js apps. If you are a beginner wondering about the folder hierarchy, most of the repo was generated by [CloudPebble](http://www.cloudpebble.net).

----------

If you have a cool idea for an improvement, you can contribute. To test your changes, simply

3. Make changes and test app on your watch through CloudPebble.
4. Use CloudPebble to push changes to your forked repo.
5. Send me a pull request

You don't *have* to contribute in code. You can tweet me any of your ideas or other feedback [@Antrikshy](http://twitter.com/Antrikshy).
